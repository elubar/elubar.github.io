### About Me

Welcome to my site. I am a 3rd year graduate student in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin where I work on instrumentation and stellar/planetary science. My advisor is Dr. Dan Jaffe and I work closely with Dr. Cindy Brooks and Dr. Greg Mace in my research. I was previously a Research Tech at Penn State University working on the [NEID](https://neid.psu.edu/) and [HPF](https://hpf.psu.edu/what-is-hpf/) spectrographs. I have also dabbled in radio astronomy and SETI research in the past. I believe respect is a part of research and that universal design and inclusive practices are essential to improving academic enviroments and centering the well being of the most marginalized groups.

### Current Instrumentation Projects
- Ongoing development of Si immersion gratings and grisms using a lithography/wet etch technique 
- Characterization of fabricated Si immersion gratings (high precision blaze determination, spectral purity, et al)
- Redesigning and inital alingment of our UV exposure sysem, a critical step in the immersion grating/grism fabrication process.

### Current Science Projects
- Observing large collection of brown dwarf and low mass stars with the [Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS)](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/igrins.html), a high resolution IR spectrograph currently on Gemini South
- Determining physical parameteres of brown dwarfs via IGRINS observations to compare with current models and ultimately learn about the physics of evolution at and around the substellar boundary
