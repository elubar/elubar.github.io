### About Me

Welcome to my site. I have recently obtained my Masters degree in astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin. My thesis focus was instrumentation-  I developed and carried out detailed precision characterization of our in-house fabricated silicon immersion gratings as well as produced the early stages of a full prorotype spectrograph design/concept.

I was previously a Research Tech at Penn State University working on the [NEID](https://neid.psu.edu/) and [HPF](https://hpf.psu.edu/what-is-hpf/) spectrographs. Earlier in my career I also dabbled in radio astronomy during my REU at Arecibo Observatory and some [theoretical](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AJ....156..260W/abstract) and observational (paper link coming soon) SETI work. I believe respect is a part of research and that universal design and inclusive practices are essential to improving academic enviroments and centering the well being of the most marginalized groups. In my free time I like reading science fiction/visionary fiction, running, sewing, and singing loudly when I'm alone in the clean room.

In my future career work I am excited to move away from purely academic work and toward industry in some capacity. I am looking to work with cubesat/smallsat hardware and gain experience with space-based instrumentation development, procedures, and mission operations. 

<!--### Current Instrumentation Projects
- Ongoing development of Si immersion gratings and grisms using a lithography/wet etch technique 
- Characterization of fabricated Si immersion gratings: high precision blaze determination, spectral purity, et al
- Redesigning and alingment of our UV exposure sysem, a critical step in the immersion grating fabrication process.

### Current Science Projects
- Observing large collection of brown dwarf and low mass stars with the [Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS)](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/igrins.html), a high resolution IR spectrograph currently on Gemini South
- Determining physical parameteres of brown dwarfs via IGRINS observations to compare with current models and ultimately learn about the physics of evolution at and around the substellar boundary -->
