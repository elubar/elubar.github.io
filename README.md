(site under construction!)

Welcome. I am a 3rd year graduate student in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin


### Research Interests

I currently specialize in instrumentation and stellar/planetary science. I was previously a Research Tech at Penn State University working on the [NEID] (https://neid.psu.edu/) and HPF spectrographs. 


### Current Instrumentation Projects
- Ongoing development and fabrication of in-house fabricated silicon immersion gratings and grisms
- Mid- and post-development characterization of fabricated gratings (high precision blaze determination, spectral purity, etc)
- Redesigning and alinging the UV exposure sysem used to fabricate our silicon immersion gratings and grisms



### Current Science Projects
- Observing large collection of brown dwarf and low mass stars with IGRINS, and high resolution IR spectrograph currently on Gemini South
- Determination of physical parameteres of brown dwarf to learn about their eveolution and compare observation to current models
