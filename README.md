### About Me

I am a 3rd year graduate student in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin where I work on instrumentation and stellar/planetary science. I was previously a Research Tech at Penn State University working on the [NEID](https://neid.psu.edu/) and [HPF](https://hpf.psu.edu/what-is-hpf/) spectrographs. I have also dabbled in radio astronomy and SETI research in the past. I believe respect is a part of research and that universal design and inclusive practices are essential to evoling academia toward its ideal state. 

### Current Instrumentation Projects
- Ongoing development and fabrication of in-house fabricated silicon immersion gratings and grisms
- Mid- and post-development characterization of fabricated gratings (high precision blaze determination, spectral purity, etc)
- Redesigning and alinging the UV exposure sysem used to fabricate our silicon immersion gratings and grisms

### Current Science Projects
- Observing large collection of brown dwarf and low mass stars with the [Immersion GRating Infrared Spectrometer (IGRINS)](https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/igrins.html), a high resolution IR spectrograph currently on Gemini South
- Determining physical parameteres of brown dwarfs via IGRINS observations to compare with current models and ultimately learn about the physics of their age evolution
